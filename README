Clutter-Box2d
=============

A glue layer between clutter and box2d that provides a special group where the
actors can be set to be static or dynamic in regard to a physics simulation. The
source tree currently contains an embedded version of box2d trunk.

Features
--------

Automatic creation of body for actors added to a special ClutterBox2D group.
Three different types of clutter-box2d bodies can be created. Static, dynamic
and meta. Static bodies affect collisions, dynamic bodies are also affected by
collisions, meta bodies are tracked for position from the actor. At the moment
the only shape available for collision tracking is the boundig box of the
individiual actor.

Features:
  - Children of the ClutterBox2d group can be set to be static or dynamic
  - changing the gravity of the simulation.
  - play/pause control over the box2d physics engine
  - automatic position synchronization between clutter and box2d.
  - joints
      - prismatic.
      - revolute.
      - distance (spring)
      - mouse (for dragging objects aroud and manipulating them).

Limitations:
 - Anchor points different from 0,0 probably does not work correctly.

TODO:
  - debug drawing of
      - joints
      - shapes
  - joints 
       - access to motor functionality of prismatic and revolute joints.
  - other shapes than clutter synced boxes.
  - add a scale factor between clutter units and box2d units since now 1px = 1m
  - memory/lifetime handling for joint proxy objects
  - full introspective capabilities
