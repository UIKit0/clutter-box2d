actors can be set to be static or dynamic in regard to a physics simulation.

Preparing box2d
===============

Download the svn trunk of box2d using:

$ svn co https://box2d.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/box2d box2d

To link against box2d apply the patch in the root of the clutter-box2d
distribution to the unix makefiles of box2d to allow building a shared library
as well as installing it with usable headers. Paths used by box2d are hardcoded
with /usr/local/ for now waiting to see how box2d finally settles it's build
system.

If applying the patch or building fails, you can try specifically checking out
version 139 by appending -r 139 to the checkout commandline.
