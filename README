Clutter-Box2d
=============

A glue layer between clutter and box2d that provides a special group where the
actors can be set to be static or dynamic in regard to a physics simulation.

Features
--------

Automatic creation of body for actors added to a special ClutterBox2D group.
Three different types of clutter-box2d bodies can be created. Static, dynamic
and meta. Static bodies affect collisions, dynamic bodies are also affected by
collisions, meta bodies are tracked for position from the actor. At the moment
the only shape available for collision tracking is the boundig box of the
individiual actor.

Features:
  - static and dynamic bodies
  - automatic position updates between clutter and box2d
  - joints
      - prismatic
      - revolute
      - distance (spring)

Limitations:
 - Anchor points different from 0,0 probably does not work correctly.

TODO:
  - debug drawing
      - joints
      - shapes
  - joints 
       - accessto motor functionality of prismatic and revolute joints.
  - memory/lifetime handling for joint proxy objects
  - handle removal of actors properly making bodies vanish from simulation
  - allow toggling dynamic/static/meta/none physical state on an actor freely
  - full introspective capabilities

Compiling
---------

Download the svn trunk of box2d using:

$ svn co https://box2d.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/box2d box2d

To link against box2d apply the patch in the root of the clutter-box2d
distribution to the unix makefiles of box2d to allow building a shared library
as well as installing it with usable headers. Paths used by box2d are hardcoded
with /usr/local/ for now waiting to see how box2d finally settles it's build
system.

If applying the patch or building fails, you can try specifically checking out
version 139 by appending -r 139 to the checkout commandline.
