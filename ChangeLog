	of building it together with clutter-box2d.

	* clutter-box2d: ... here to a new directory.

	* clutter-box2d.cpp: add a scale factor that makes 1px = ~5cm in
	the simulation, making it smaller currently harms stability of box2d,
	it should be made user tunable. Modified default gravity to be
	of similar magnitude to dimensions.

2008-04-10  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am: updated build system according to expanded
	sandbox.

	control over which scene is currently being shown.

	movement and manipulation, has mods both for dynamic box2d objects and
	non physics based movement.

	* README:
	* clutter-box2d.cpp: manage joint resources, currently the
	ClutterBox2DJoint instances are managed automatically like
	Box2D Joints, the pointer to the joint becomes invalid if
	any one of the actors forming part of the joint is removed
	from the Box2D group. Some code cleanup/reindentation.
	* clutter-box2d.h: some code cleanup/reindentation.

	static/dynamic state on the fly.

2008-04-09  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter-box2d.cpp: create mapping structure upon actor-added and
	actor-removed signals on ClutterBox2d container instead of on demand.
	This improves sanity of resource management.

	build.
	* Makefile.am: list all box2d cpp files as files that go into the
	clutter-box2d library.
	* box2d/: imported revision 140 from box2d svn directly into source
	tree.

	_apply_torque _set_bullet _is_bullet.

2008-04-09  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>
